Agile Development Process
* Git
* Daily Scrum
* Trello Board (Kanban)


STEPS:
>> Trello
1. Register for Trello account
2. *Leader* creates one Trello board for the project (private), invites the other participants (teammates).
Trello Board columns:
> Backlog/Planning
> WorkingOnIt/InProgress
> DoneNeedsTesting
> Finished

>> Git, .gitignore, project setup, and Daily Scrum
3. *Leader* create one Git repository for the project (private), invites the other participants (teammates).
4. *Leader* adds senditaway@hotmail.com to both Git repository and Trello board (Teacher's account).
5. *Leader* creates "dailyscrum.txt" file in the Git repository (use the online access).
6. Each team member clones the Git repository locally.
7. *Leader* creates the VSCode/NodeJS project inside of that repository, directly under, no subdirectory.
8. *Leader* verifies that .gitignore in the main directory of the project exists and is configured for NodeJS projects.
9. *Leader* committs/pushes the inital code. Then other team members fetch/update their working copies.

>> Database cloud-hosted
