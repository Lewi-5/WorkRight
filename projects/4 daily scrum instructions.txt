DAILY SCRUM - EVERY DAY AT 9AM (as soon as  you arrive)
==========================================================

In your shared Git repository create file "dailyscrum.txt".
Both members of the team will write to this one file every morning at 9am.

Each member writes down answers to 3 questions in the following format:

<< current date goes here >>
1. What I have done / not done since last Scrum?
2. What I plan to do from this scrum to next? (next 24 hours)
3. Where do I need assistance? What do I need to figure out?

Example entries for one day, both team members:
